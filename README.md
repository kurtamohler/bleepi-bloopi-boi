sometimes we bleep, sometimes we bloop

## Details

This project contains software for an interactive audio device made with the
[Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html) and the
[Teensy audio board](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3_audio.html).

## Install

Download and install the latest [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

Install the [Teensyduino library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html).

## Build and run

Open one of the sketches (`*.ino` files) from this project in the Arduino IDE.
Click the "Verify" button to build it.

If you have a Teensy and audio board, follow the
[basic Teensyduino usage](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_usage.html)
instructions to upload the sketch to the board. Of course, the software may run,
but it won't really do anything if you don't have the rest of the hardware
required for this project.
